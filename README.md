# Monte_carlo_importance_sampling

% Racing on a simulated course. The agent learns to navigate and complete a 
% non-trivial course without crashing into the borders in the shortest
% time possible. In order to do this, the agent must manage its
% velocity vector in 2-D. It can accelerate in either component by +- 1
% pixel per iteration, and neither component can be negative. On every
% iteration the agent recieves a reward of -1. Episodes conclude when the
% agent crosses the finish line. If it intersects with the track's boundary 
% on any iteration it must return to the starting line. This simulation
% utilizes an off-policy Monte Carlo learning algorithm.
